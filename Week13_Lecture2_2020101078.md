>Given that our quantum memory register differs from a classical one in that it can store a superposition of the base states of the register, one might wonder what this implies as to the efficiency of quantum computing. The study of quantum computing is relatively new, most give credit to *Richard Feynman* for being the first to suggest that there were tasks that a quantum computer could perform exponentially better than a classical computer. Feynman observed that a classical computer could not simulate a quantum mechanical system without suffering from exponential slowdown. At the same time he hinted that perhaps by using a device whose behavior was inherently quantum in nature one could simulate such a system without this exponential slowdown.

### EFFICIENT INTEGER FACTORIZATION USING QUANTUM COMPUTERS

### SHOR'S ALGORITHM - Efficient Quantum Algorithm for Integer Factorization

#### STEP 1

**FACTORING is reduced to finding a non-trivial square root of 1 modulo N.**
 
> *Lemma* - If x is a non-trivial square root of 1 modulo N, then $gcd(1+x, N)$ is a nontrivial factor.
> $x$<sup>2</sup> $\equiv$ $1$ mod $N$ implies that $N$ divides $x$<sup>2</sup> $- 1 = (x + 1)(x - 1)$, where $x \not\equiv 1$ mod $N$.\
Therefore N must have a nontrivial factor in common with each of $x+1$ and $x-1$.

>Example, Let $N=15$, Then $4^2 \equiv 1$ mod $15$, but $4 \not\equiv 1$ mod $15$. Both $gcd(4 -1, 15) = 3$ and $gcd(4 + 1, 15) = 5$ are non-trivial factors of $15$.

Therefore, if you are able to find such a $x$, you can find non-trivial factors of $N$.

Since $gcd$ computation is efficient, we have reduced the problem of factorization to find the non trivial square root of $1$ modulo $N$.

This reduction is not classically useful as finding the non trivial square root of $1$ modulo $N$ is as hard as factorization (we have just found a reduction of one problem to another so it must be as hard, if not more, as the previous one).

In the lemma, we mention only $gcd(x+1, N)$, as we need only one factor for once, after that the number reduces after dividing it by the factor and we can recurse.

#### STEP 2

**Finding such a root is reduced to computing the order of a random integer modulo N.**

>**Problem** - Find a $x$ in $[1, N-1]$ such that $x^2$ modulo $N = 1$.

There is no classical efficient algorithm to find such a $x$. We reduce this problem to finding the order of a random integer modulo $N$.

> **ORDER(x)** - The smallest positive integer $r$ such that $x^r \equiv 1$ mod $N$.

>Choose a random $x$ and assume gcd(x, N) = 1. If r, the order of x, is even then a non-trivial square root of 1 is $x$<sup>$r/2$</sup>.

>*Example* - If $x = 2$ and $N = 15$, them the order of $2$ is $4$ since $2^4 \equiv 1$ mod $15$. Raising 2 to half this power, we get a non-trivial root of 1, $2^2 = 4 \not\equiv 1$ mod $15$. $gcd(4 + 1, 15) = 5$ is a divisor of 15.

>*Note* - If $x$ is not co-prime to N, then there will exist no $r$, such that $x^r \equiv 1$ mod $N$. Thus $order(x)$ is only well-defined when $x$ is co-prime to $N$.

This is called a *randomized reduction*.

Quantum algorithms are themselves randomized and probabilistic thus a classical randomized reduction shouldn't harm.

So all we need to do to find a non-trivial factor of N is to choose a random x, check if it's order is even, if no, choose another number (the probability of the order being even in the next chance increases exponentially), if yes, it's square root will turn out to be a square root of 1, and gcd(square_root + 1, N) will be a factor of N.

A proof in number theory shows that for $x$ in $[1, N-1]$, half the integers will have odd *order*, and half of them will have even *order*.

#### STEP 3

This is the step where the quantum aspect arises.

**The order of an integer is precisely the period of a particular periodic superposition.**

There is no efficient algorithm known to find the *order* of a random integer $x$ modulo N. A linear search for $r$ will take $O(2*N)$. But there exists a efficient quantum algorithm to find order. 

First, we will find a periodic function with period = *order(x)*, then quantum compute that function at collapse it to a particular value. 

The function is classically efficiently computable.

$f(a) = x^a$ mod $N$

If $r$ is the order of $x$,

$f(0) = f(r) = f(2r) = ... = 1$ 

$f(1) = f(r + 1) = f(2r + 1) = ... = x$

Thus $f$ is periodic, with period $r$.

The problem of order finding is further reduced to finding the period of $f$.

**Setting up the periodic superposition**

### Quantum Parallelism

>*Quantum parallelism* arises from the ability of a quantum memory register to exist in a superposition of base states. A quantum memory register can exist in a superposition of states, each component of this superposition may be thought of as a single argument to a function. 

>A function performed on the register in a superposition of states is thus performed on each of the components of the superposition, but this function is only applied one time. Since the number of possible states is $2^n$ where n is the number of *qubits* in the quantum register, you can perform in one operation on a quantum computer what would take an exponential number of operations on a classical computer. This is fantastic, but the more superposed states that exist in you register, the smaller the probability that you will measure any particular one will become.

#### MASSIVE PARALLELISM
This is a general step explaining how does any quantum algorithm solve for any given function.
A $n$ quibit system is the superposition of their $2^n$ possible states.

The middle steps are all simple unitary transformations. 

By linearity,

$$ U_f(\frac {1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum^{2^n-1}_{x=0} |x,0>) = \frac {1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum^{2^n-1}_{x=0} U_f(|x,0>) = \frac {1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum^{2^n-1}_{x=0} |x,f(x)> $$

Measure the second register. This gives a periodic superposition on the first register, with period r, the period of f.
*How do we get the superposition ?*

#### STEP 4

**Finally, periods of superpositions can be efficiently found by the quantum FFT.**
