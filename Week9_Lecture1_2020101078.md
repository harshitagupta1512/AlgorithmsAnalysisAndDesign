## Randomized Algorithms

A hard problem is the one which has no **efficient** algorithm to solve it. 

Deterministic Problem and Solutions - 
When the situation/problem is not deterministic, which step to take next after a particular step to reach the correct solution is not clear.
Here we introduce the concept of randomized algorithms.

An algorithm that uses random numbers to decide what to do next anywhere in it's logic is called a **Randomized Algorithm**.

Randomized algorithms may look chaotic and incorrect at first glance. From the viewpoint of algorithm designer, it may look like he has lost control over the algorithm. On the other hand randomized algorithms handicaps the adversory. The notion of worst case for the algorithm is lost. Randomized algorithm can take different paths for different inputs. 

>For example, in Randomized Quick Sort, we use a random number to pick the next pivot (or we randomly shuffle the array). Expected worst case time complexity of this algorithm is also O(n Log n), but analysis is complex.

Some of the questions that are still unanswered in this domain are 

>*What class of problems can be solved by randomized approach ?*

>Some say the answer is BPP - **Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time (BPP)** is the class of decision problems solvable by a probabilistic turing machine in polynomial time with an error probability bounded away from 1/3 for all instances.

>Informally, a problem is in BPP if there is an algorithm for it that has the following characterstics:\
It is allowed to flip coins and make random decisions.\
It is guaranteed to run in polynomial time.\
On any given run of the algorithm, it has a probability of at most 1/3 of giving the wrong answer, whether the answer is YES or NO.

>*What is the maximum speed achievable by randomized algorithms? Is it exponential ?*

When a problem has no proper deterministic algorithm, we turn towards randomized algorithms. 

>The idea is to create several deterministic algorithms say $A_1, A_2, A_3, ...., A_n$ (Here n might be exponential). None of these algorithms directly solve the problem. For any input, there are at least $2k/3$ values if i such that algorithm $A_i$ correctly solves the problem at hand. Different algorithms may solve the problem for different inputs. None of them gives the correct answer for all inputs. For a given input, pick one of the algorithms and compute the solution. The probability of getting the correct answer being $2/3$. Pick another algorithm and consider the answer to be correct if both the algorithms give the same answer. The probability of getting the incorrect answer here being $1/9$ and so on. Some people use the 3-majority circuit approach. 

### Primality Testing

For primality testing, randomized approach is the best known and tested algorithm.

On input p, if `p` is `prime` the answer is `YES` otherwise `NO`.

#### Algorithm

>`Step 1`  If p is even, `accept` if $p==2$, else `reject`.\
`Step 2`Select `k` random number in `[1, p-1]`, call them $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...... a_k$.\
`Step 3` For each $a_i$\
`Step 3.1` Either parallelly or sequentially, compute $a_i$<sup>p-1</sup> $mod$ $p$, and `reject` if not equal `1`. (Deterministic step).
>>This step is based on `Fermat's little theorem, if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number $a^p -a$` is an integer multiple of p. Special Case - When a is not divisible by p,  $a_i$<sup>p-1</sup> - 1 is an integer multiple of p. Hence, $a_i$<sup>p-1</sup> % $p = 1$.\
The converse is not true, if $a_i$<sup>p-1</sup> % $p = 1$, does not necessarliy imply that p is prime.

>`Step 3.2` Let $p - 1 = st$, where s is odd and t is a power of 2 say $2^h$.
`Step 3.3` Compute sequence $a_i^s, a_i$<sup>2s</sup> ... $a_i$<sup>2<sup>n</sup>s</sup> mod $p$. Here the every element in the sequence is between $1$ and $p -1$ and the last element in the sequence is $1$.\
`Step 3.4` Find the last/rightmost element in the sequence that is not equal to 1. If that element is not equal to -1 either, `reject`.

>`Step 4` If all tests have passed at this point, `accept`.

>For example, p = 15, for $a_i = 2$, it will be rejected at step 3.1, as $2^15$ mod 15 = 4. Though for $a_i = 4$, it will be rejected at step 3.4. There can be values for $a_i$ which will accept p as prime, but there are atleast $2/3 a_i$ that will reject 15 as prime.

#### PROOF
*How do we know that randomized algorithm for primality testing works?*

>If input is *prime*, the algorithm always accepts it as prime. If input is *composite*, the algorithm will reject it with a probability of $1 - 1/2^k$. \
As we increase k, time/space complexity will increase but higher the k, more accurate the algorithm will be. The probability of getting the correct answer approaches *1*.

>*First part of the PROOF - If p is prime, the algorithm always `accepts`.*
>>Rejection only takes place in step 4 and 7. Since Fermat's little theorem states that $a_i$<sup>p-1</sup> % $p = 1$, it will never be rejected in step 4. \
*Will it reject in step 7 ?*\
We need to prove that the last element which is not $1$ in the sequence $a_i^s, a_i$<sup>2s</sup> ... $a_i$<sup>2<sup>n</sup>s</sup> mod $p$ is $-1$. Let this element be the j<sup>th</sup> element in the sequence. (j<sup>th</sup> element)<sup>2</sup> mod $p = 1$ as every next element in the sequence is the square of the previous element mod p and all elements from the j+1<sup>th</sup> till the last element equals $1$. Let the j<sup>th</sup> element = b.\
We have $b^2$ mod p = 1, $b \ne 1$. There are two solutions to this equation for p = prime.\
$b^2 - 1$ mod $p = 0$\
$(b-1)(b+1)$ mod $p = 0$\
We know that $b \epsilon [1, p-1]$\
$b-1 \epsilon [0, p-2]$\
$b+1 \epsilon [2, p]$.\
Thus for $(b-1)(b+1)$ mod $p = 0$, that is (b-1)(b+1) is divisble by p, there are 2 possible cases, either $b - 1 = 0$, $b = 1$ OR $b + 1 = p - 1$, that is b mod p = -1 or 1.\
Since p is prime, it must occur in prime factorization of $b - 1$ or $b+1$.\
In case p is composite, it need not divide $b-1$ or $b+1$ directly, it may divide the product only.\
Thus p will never be rejected in step 7. 

>*Second part of the PROOF - If p is composite, the probability that the algorithm `accepts` p as prime $\le 1/2^k$.*
>>Even composite are already rejected.\
Probability that $a_i$ rejects p as prime is atleast $1/2$, when p is composite.\
Probability (never rejected) = Probability (accepted) = Probability($a_1$ didn't reject) * Probability($a_2$ didn't reject) * Probability($a_3$ didn't reject) ... Probability($a_n$ didn't reject) = $1/2^k$ \
Number of witnesses of compositeness for p outnumber the number of non-witnesses. That is, number of $a_i$ which reject p as prime outnumber the number of $a_i$ which accept p as prime, when p is actually composite. To prove this we map a one to one function from the set of non-witnesses to the set of witnesses. |Domain| $\le$ |Range|, |Non-Witnesses| $\le$ |Witnesses|. Thus probability($a_i$ is a witness) $\ge 1/2 $.  We consider a the non-witnesses that reject p in step 7. Take the non -witness with -1 at the rightmost position (say j). Let the non-witness be h and j be it's location in the sequence. \
h<sup>h2<sup>j</sup></sup> mod p = -1,\
h<sup>h2<sup>j + 1</sup></sup> mod p = -1\
$p$ is *composite* implies either $p$ is a power of a prime number OR p is the product of 2 relatively prime numbers (say q and r). We prove that it is possible to find a number t in both cases which is a witness.\
By the *chinese remainder theorem*, there exist $t$ in $[0, p]$, $t$ mod $q$ =  $h$ mod $q$ and $t$ mod $r = 1$.\
Thus t<sup>s2<sup>j</sup></sup> $\ne$ +-1 mod $p$, though t<sup>s2<sup>j + 1</sup></sup> $\ne$ 1 mod $p$.\
Hence t is a witness of compositeness i.e. t will reject p as prime.
