### An experiment with photons

**The Three Polarizers**

We know that if we take a light source and a screen and place a horizontal polarizer between the two, $50$ % of photos pass through it. 
In case we place a horizontal polarizer followed by a vertical polarizer no light reaches the screen. 
In case of horizontal polarizer followed by a polarizer kept at an angle of 45 followed by a vertical polarizer $1/8$ th of the light from the source reaches the screen.

This is bizarre because intuitively  we say this if polarizer A and C can block the flow of light then obviously polarizers A, B and C will together stop the flow of the light too which is not the case here. This is not possible in macro world. In other words, in the case of polarizers we say that what A and C can do together themselves they can't do with B. 

Quantum is as real as real life more with respect to the micro world.

Conclusion - Light behaves different from conventional fluids. 

We need a form of mathematics to capture these differences and postulates to explain these observations.

### Quibits

In simple system called *Quibits* where there are only two possible outcomes (for example, the photons will pass the polarizer or not) the reality is the superposition of those outcomes.

A quantum bit or quibit is a unit vector in a 2-D complex vector space for which a particular basis has been fixed. 

Quibits are denoted as {$| 0 >, | 1 >$}

Quibits can be in a superposition of $|0>$ and $|1>$ such as $a|0> + b|1>$ where a and b are complex numbers such that $|a|$<sup>2</sup> + $|b|$<sup>2</sup> = 1.

#### Measuring a Quibit

The physical interpretation is:

For the quibit $a|0> + b|1>$, the probability that the measurement value is $|0>$ is $|a|$<sup>2</sup> after which the state collapses to $|0>$ and the probability that the measurement value is $|1>$ is $|b|$<sup>2</sup> after which the state collapses to $|1>$.

#### Quibit model correctly predicts the outcome of our photon/three polarizers experiment *and several other experiments too*

Before passing through the vertical let our quibit be $a|0> + b|1>$, 0 is for not passing the polarizer, and 1 for the converse. Given random conditions, we expect a = b and this $|a|$<sup>2</sup> = $1/2$. Thus about 50 percent of photons are expected to pass through the vertical polarizer or in that case for any orientation of the polarizer. 

Second aspect of the experiment-Given that a photon passes through the horizontal polarizer it will not pass through the vertical polarizer i.e probability that a photon pass through a horizontal polarizer followed by a vertical polarizer = 0.

The third aspect of the experiment is that if there is a polarizer at 45 degree inclination midway, 50 percent photons pass through horizontal polarizer, horizontally polarized photons pass through 5 degree inclined polarizer with probability $1/2$ again. After passing through the 45 degree inclined polarizer the photons will collapse to being 45 degree polarized. Again the probability that these 45 degree polarized photons pass through vertical  polarizer is $1/2$.

### Superposition postulate
Associated with any quantum system there is a state vector in hilbert space. The reality is the superposition of all possible outcomes. If there are $n$ possible outcomes the result will be a $c$<sup>$n$</sup> state vector in hilbert space.

### Measurement and collapse properties
If you measure parts of the system, your measurements will collapse in line with what you measure. The mathematics is defined using projections and inner products of state vectors.

### Evolution Postulate

**Unitary Transformations**
>In the Hilbert space formulation of states in quantum mechanics a unitary transformation corresponds to a rotation of axes in the Hilbert space. Such a transformation does not alter the state vector, but a given state vector has different components when the axes are rotated.

### No-Cloning Theorem 

The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This theorem has profound implications in quantum computing and related fields.
The theorem follows from the fact that all quantum operations must be unitary linear transformation on the state.

### Multiple Quibits
>Wht the prediction that quantum computers exist and why they will be more powerful then what we can ever imagine otherwise.

For $1$ Quibit there are $2$ possible answers and this number of possible outcomes grows exponentially. 
Generally, different systems in this case, quibits, are put together using cartesian product. 
But in quantum mechanics, owing to the superposition principle, we need to associate a probability with each possible outcome and say in case of 3 quibits we would need 8 complex numbers/ vectors to describe the system.
The reality is a superposition of $2$<sup>$n$</sup> possible outcomes each associated with some probability.

In more formal language, individual state spaces of $n$ particles combine classically through the cartesian product. Quantum states, however, combine through the $tensor product$.
For example,

A basis for a three qubit system is {$|000 > , | 001 > , |010 > , |011 > , |100 > , |101 > , |110 > , | 111 >$}

and in general an $n$ qubit system has $2$<sup>$n$</sup> basis vectors.

This shows the exponential growth of the state space with the number of quantum particles. 

*What does all of this imply ?* In simple terms, take one mole of hydrogen, each hydrogen atom has a electron which can be a ground or excited state. As quantum mechanics say the reality will be the superposition of all the possible states of all the 1 mole electrons. If we ask what will be the reality/state of the system be say next 5 minutes, our classical computers will take years to compute (exponential matrix multiplication) that though nature does it in real time. The key is instead of performing the computation we build a real system akin to the state vector and a real transformation akin to the real matrix multiplication and observe the outcome. 

This relation between *nature* and *computation* is the key. We prefer using the faster method observing the nature evolve or compute the outcome. 

Any unitary approximation van be approximated by some basic unitary approximations.

### Quantum Entanglements
>Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way such that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. 

For example, The state $|00 > +|11 >$ cannot be described in terms of it's components (qubits) separately. That is to say We cannot find $a_1 , a_2 , b_1 , b_2$ such that

$(a_1 |0 > + b_1 |1 > ) ⊗ (a_2 |0 > + b_2 |1 > ) = |00 > + |11 > =$ 

$a_1a_2 |00 > + a_1b_2 |01 > + b_1a_2 |10 > + b_1b_2 |11 >$ 

which means $a_1b_2 = 0$ which implies that either $a_1a_2 = 0$ or $b_1b_2 = 0$.

States which cannot be decomposed in this way are called *entangled states*.

### Quantum Gates
In *quantum computing*, a *quantum logic gate* is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of *qubits*. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.

In the classical world, we say any computation can be exactly simulated using a circuit of only NAND gates or say basis set of {AND, OR, NOT} gates. Similarly every unitary transformation can be simulated by a basis set of basic unitary transformations. Different basis can have different levels of efficiency. We try to build a quantum computer that can work on those basic transformations and build circuits over that.

### Quantum Circuits
A *quantum circuit* is a computational routine consisting of coherent quantum operations on quantum data, such as *qubits*, and concurrent real-time classical computation. It is an ordered sequence of quantum gates, measurements and resets, all of which may be conditioned on and use data from the real-time classical computation.

A set of quantum gates is said to be *universal* if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set. Any quantum program can be represented by a sequence of quantum circuits and non-concurrent classical computation.

### Quantum Teleportation

Consider a single quibit quantum system at Alice's end, we want to convert that to information, pass 
the information to Bob, and Bob should be able to reconstruct the information.

The objective is to transmit the quantum state of a particle using classical bits and reconstruct the exact quantum state at the receiver.

The idea is to convert the reality into bits and information, communicate the information and reconstruct the reality at the other end.

It does not contradict the no cloning theorem because until the reality will appear at the second end, it will disappear from the first end.

It will be a 3-Quibit system, the first quibit being the one to be transported from Alice's end.

To transfer a quantum bit, Alice and Bob must use a third party (Telamon) to send them an entangled qubit pair. Alice then performs some operations on her qubit, sends the results to Bob over a classical communication channel, and Bob then performs some operations on his end to receive Alice’s qubit.

### The setting

#### Step 1
A third party, Telamon, creates an entangled pair of qubits and gives one to Bob and one to Alice.

The pair Telamon creates is a special pair called a Bell pair. In quantum circuit language, the way to create a Bell pair between two qubits is to first transfer one of them to the X-basis ( |+⟩  and |−⟩ ) using a Hadamard gate, and then to apply a CNOT gate onto the other qubit controlled by the one in the X-basis. Let's say Alice owns q1 and Bob owns q2 after they part ways.

#### Step 2
Alice applies a CNOT gate to q1, controlled by |ψ⟩ (the qubit she is trying to send Bob). Then Alice applies a Hadamard gate to |ψ⟩. In our quantum circuit, the qubit (|ψ⟩) Alice is trying to send is q0.

#### Step 3
Next, Alice applies a measurement to both qubits that she owns, q1 and |ψ⟩, and stores this result in two classical bits. She then sends these two bits to Bob.

 #### Step 4
 Bob, who already has the qubit q2, then applies the following gates depending on the state of the classical bits:
00 → Do nothing
01 → Apply X gate
10 → Apply Z gate
11 → Apply ZX gate

*At the end of this protocol, Alice's qubit has now teleported to Bob.*
