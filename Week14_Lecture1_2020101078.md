## BYZANTINE AGREEMENT 
**Possibility and Protocols**

### Problem
#### Consensus 
You have a real peer to peer network (S), no physical broadcast channel available. The problem is to simulate a broadcast channel in a P2P network. Consider a real network, with a sender $S$, and we want to overlay a broadcast channel with S so that it can send a message to all peers at once (broadcast).

*Why is it so difficult for S to broadcast a message to all peers in a network with considerable connectivity ?*

*Naive solution* - S send the message to all peers one by one. Let's say S is even connected to all peers directly.
Suppose S has 2 other peers A and B, suppose using the naive solution, after S sends the message to A and before S sends the message to B, there is a network failure, thus for B the broadcast never happened. With a physical broadcast either all peers will receive the message or none will. Therefore the solution where the sender is asked to send the message to each sender individually is not the proper simulation of an *atomic* broadcast. What we were trying was to simulate the broadcast in a series of steps in which case if some of them are executed successfully and some of them fail and we are likely to end up in a situation which will be quite unlikely in case of a physical broadcast. Agreement between peers about whether the broadcast happened or not is the key point.
Failure in broadcast is acceptable but, failure in agreement is not.
There are many settings where such broadcast of messages is required which cannot be simulated by asking the person (center/sender) to send the message to every receiver one by one.

Consider a more challenging case of byzantine agreement where, there could be viruses with malicious intent where the sender ends up sending different messages to different receivers. In case of physical broadcast, receivers have a agreement on receiving the same message. 

The problem of BYZANTINE agreement is therefore that even if the sender is dishonest and trying to fool the system by sending different messages to different people, at the end of the protocol there should be an agreement among the receivers about what was the message.

#### Formal Definition of BYZANTINE AGREEMENT
Each process starts with an input from a fixed set $V =$ {$0,1$}. The goal is for the players to eventually output decisions from the set $V$ upholding the following conditions, even in the presence of an adversary that can byzantinely corrupt up to any $t$ of the $n$ players:
* Agreement: All non faulty processes decide on the same value $u \epsilon V$
* Validity: If all non-faulty processes start with the same initial value $u \epsilon V$, then $u = v$.
* Termination: All non faulty processes eventually decide.

Non-terminating protocols are not considered as practical solutions.

Both forms of the BYZANTINE AGREEMENT described above are equivalent. If there is a physical broadcast, you can solve the byzantine agreement as defined in the textbook, on the other hand, if you can solve the byzantine agreement as defined, you can also simulate a physical broadcast channel. 

Asking the sender to send the message to everybody is not enough because what if it sends different message to different people. In this case, after the broadcast we run the byzantine agreement protocol and ensure that if the sender is non-faulty, all non-faulty receivers receives the same message.

To simulate a physical broadcast channel.

To design a protocol where everybody start with an input and every non-faulty process have to agree on the same *valid* output.

Byzantine agreement have multiple different forms. 
undirected graph, bidirectional channels, local physical broadcast - hyper graphs, synchronous or asynchronous, quantum protocols.

Certain byzantine agreement solutions work correctly only if it is the only protocol running in the network but if there is any other protocol running in the network apart from it,  it fails to run correctly.

### Impossibility 
The problem od byzantine agreement is not only difficult to solve but impossible in certain settings.
If there are 3 people A, B and C in a network and one of them is faulty, then no byzantine agreement protocol exists for the system. 
*How do you prove that certain distributed computing algorithm does not exist ?*
#### PROOF
Proof by *contradiction*
Assume there is a byzantine agreement in a network with 3 devices, one of which is faulty.
We can prove that if this is the case, there exists another protocol that solves the agreement in a network, say $\alpha$ with 6 nodes which is inconsistent(self-contradictory).
Suppose in the network $ABC$, with the byzantine agreement, A is faulty and B and C start with input 0, output of B should be 0 because it should be valid for which it should belong to the set of inputs i.e. {0}. So if B and C start with input 0, both should output 0. And this must be the case for any kind of fault in A.\
Consider network $\alpha$, A, B and C start with input 0, A' and B' start with input 1. B and C cannot differentiate whether they are in network $\alpha$ or $\aplha 1$.
In this state an agreement cannot be made
and thus cannot be terminated, Byzantine B can play A and C off against each other, telling A that C is Byzantine and C that A is Byzantine. Since A is telling C the same thing about B that B is saying about A, C can't tell the difference and doesn't know who to believe. It can be shown that for any system with n generals, If the number of
generals controlled by the adversary ( Byzantines ) is less than n/3 we can arrive at a proper conclusion else a valid decision cannot be made.

### Protocol for 1 out of 4
The procedure consists of exchange of messages, followed by computation of interactive consistency vector on the basis of result of exchange. Two round of information exchange is required:
• In the first round the processors exchange their input values.
• In the second round they exchange all the values obtained in the first round.

### The Message Matrix

$V_ij$ is the message that player i says it received from player j.
The message matrices differ across players by at most one row & corresponding column.

### Authenticated Byzantine Agreement (ABA)
• Processes are supplemented with “magical powers” to authenticate their communication – Digital Signatures.
• Pease et. al. showed that using authentication, fault tolerance can be increased to $t < n$.

### ABA protocol for 1 out of 3
* Player k maintains a set $W_ik$ , $\forall$ i $\epsilon$ P . Initially $W_kk$ = {$s$} where $s$ is player k’s input value.
Repeat the following steps for 2 rounds:
* Receive values from neighbors and for each received value do:
    • If the message is properly signed, he append it's content to the set $W_ik$
    • Sends i, $W_ik$ to his neighbors.
* He deletes $W_ik$ if | $W_ik$ | $\ne$ 1
* Since all remaining W ik ’s are singleton, he takes majority over all values. If a majority exists he decides on it, else decides on the default value.

### Connectivity Challenge
In a (synchronous) $P2P$ network of n nodes, t of which are (Byzantine) faulty, consensus/ agreement is possible only if the network is $(2t + 1)$-connected. With cryptography: $(t + 1)$-connectivity is  sufficient.

### Round-Complexity Challenge
In a (synchronous) P2P network of n nodes, t of which are (fail-stop / Byzantine) faulty, consensus requires $> t$ rounds, in the worst case.
