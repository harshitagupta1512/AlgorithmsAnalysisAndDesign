#### What is a computational problem ?
>**Challenges**  
>   1. Infinite ways of posing the same problem.
>2. Posing a problem without solving it.  
>3. Is it a computational problem?  
>4. What kind of tools are given/permitted to the solver?

> The way one defines a solution to a problem changes how one has defined the problem. For example, Sorting sounds like a computational problem at once but it can have non-computational solutions with well-defined steps.

>We are not looking for any solution to a given problem, we are looking specifically for computational solutions.

>Another challenge is to pose a problem without giving any hint for the solution.

>The problem of counting total number of problems becomes cumbersome when there are multiple ways of posing a problem, infinte in some cases, the question is whether to consider all of them as a single problem or different problems. For example the problem that "whether the input is 2" can be posed in multiple ways like whether the input is the smallest even number, whether the input is the smallest prime number etc. Computationally, they are a single problem.

**Computational Problem**
>Given a input, we digitalize the input and theoutput.(without loss of generality every language can be converted into binary). Every bit of the output can be considered as a decision problem. And every decision problem can be considered as a membership query in a language, because a decision problem can be stated as if the given input belongs to the set of inputs which give true answer to the given decision problem. In literature, subset of the set of all finite binary strings is called language.\
Each decision problem is characterized by a subset of the set of all possible inputs (that is, subset of, say, {0,1}*).

**Examples**
>1. Primality Testing
    PRIMES = {n | n is prime}\
    Asking whether a given input is prime is equivalent to asking whether a given input belongs to the set of primes.
>2. Example 2 : Graph Connectivity
    GC = {Graph G | G is connected}   
>3. Boolean Satisfiability
    SAT = {CNF Boolean formula f | f is not a fallacy; i.e. f is satisfiable}

All the older challenges (multiple ways to pose a  problem etc. )can resolved by defining the computational problems as membership queries.    

### What is a solution ?

**Axioms of Computation**
>1. It takes non-zero time to retrieve data from far-off locations, i.e. machines are not **omnipresent**.
>2. Only finite information can be stored/retrieved from finite volume i.e. machines are not **omniscient**.
>3. A finite length of the code can only assert finite amount of control i.e. machines are not **omnipotent** .

Any solution of the computational problem that remains coherent to the axioms of computation is considered as a computational solution.

### How to COMPARE various Solutions?
>1. Asymptotic Analysis.
>2. Worst-case Analysis.
>3. Better solutions
>4. What is TIME ?
>5. What is SPACE ?

From the above listed factors, correctness and time are most importance. i.e. time is the major factor in determing which solution is better for a given computational problem. 

#### Questions addressed in the lecture
1. What makes a problem a computational problem ?
2. What is a solution ?
3. Evaluation of a Solution (correctness, efficiency, comparison, optimality)

### Countability and Computability
#### Existence of computational problems that computers (of past, present or future) cannot solve
**Claim 1**
>There are **uncountably** many computational problems however there are **countably** many computer programs thus there exists uncountably many computational problems that **cannot** be solved by computer programs. 

**Countable Sets**
>An infinite set is countable if there is a bijection f : N -> S, from the set of natural numbers to set S.\
 The idea behind the definition is that if you want to store the elements of a set in an array you need a mapping, this element is stored at 1<sup>st</sup> position, another element is stored at 2<sup>nd</sup> position and so on. Thus, it is similar to calling a set arrayable. The concept of retrieving the i<sup>th</sup> element should makes sense. Computer programs require the ability of numerability.   

**Axiom**
>Every computer program can be rewritten in C language which can be in turn be executed by a Turing machine.

**Theorem**
>The set of **finite** length bit strings {0,1}* is countable.

>Finite is an important keyword because we consider the hypothesis that computer programs cannot be infinite as you have to store them into finite memory. 

**Proof**
>Intuitively we can strike up a one to one correspondence f : N -> {0,1}* by listing the strings in short-lex order : (Here e is the binary string of length 0). f is one to one and onto.
```
e 0 1 00 01 10 11 000 001 010 011 100...
1 2 3  4  5  6  7   8   9  10  11  12...
```

>At the end of the day, C programs are binary strings. Though every binary string is not C program but the set of all finite length binary strings is itself countable so we can remove those binary strings from the set which do not represent any C program and we will have our countable set of all possible C/computer programs.

**Uncountable Sets**
>A set is uncountable if it is not countable.

**Theorem**
>The power set of bit strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable.

>A problem in any language can be considered as a membership query. A problem can give certain number of bits as output, we consider every bit in the output as a separate decision problem. Instead of defining a decision problem as for a given input, what is the output, a decision problem can be redefined as whether the given input belongs to the **set of inputs** which give 1 as output.   
Thus the decision problem can be represented as a subset of the set of finite binary strings which are the inputs for which the output of the decision problem is yes.

Total number of problems in any language = Total number of subsets of the set of all possible finite length binary strings {0, 1}*.

**Proof**

>Any subset T in P = {0,1}* can be viewed as a function f : {0,1}* -> {0,1}. This is done by making the function take the value 1 for elements in the set, and the value 0 for elements not in the set.
>We can prove that the number of such subsets T are uncountable using Cantor Diagonalization.

### The Connection to Computing

**Turing Machine**
By the Church-Turing Hypothesis,we have -

1. If there exists an algorithm to solve a problem, then there exists a Turing machine that solves that problem.

2. If turing machine can't solve a problem , this implies the fact that there exist no algorithm or program to solve that problem.

3. C-programming language is Turing complete which implies that if there doesn't exist a C program to solve a problem, then there exist no algorithm to solve that problem .
