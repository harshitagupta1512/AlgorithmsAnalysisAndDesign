>Input : Two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $a>=b>=0$

>Output : $gcd (a,b)$

>Algorithm
```cpp
if(b == 0)
    return a
return Euclid(b, a mod b)

>**Correctness of Euclid's Algorithm**

>To prove - GCD of a and b is same as that of a mod b and b.\
We try to prove that every common divisor of a and b is a common divisor of a mod b and b and vica versa.\
Consider $gcd(a, b)$ and $gcd(a-b,b)$.\
Any integer that divides a and b i.e. is a common divisor of a and b must also divide a - b, which implies $gcd(a, b) \le gcd(a-b, b)$.\
Also integer that divides a - b and b must also divide a and b which implies $gcd (a, b) \ge gcd (a-b, b)$\
Thus $gcd (a,b) = gcd(a-b,b)$\
Infact the set of common divisors of a and b and the set of common divisors of a-b and b are the same.

Best analysis is the one which analyse the algorithm in worst case, for example, analysing Euclid's Algorithm for 2 consecutive fibonacci numbers.

**Analysis**
>**Lemma** :- If $a\ge b$, then $a$ $mod$ $b$ $< a/2$.

>**Proof** :- Consider the case when $b > a/2$, $a$ mod $b$ $=$ $a - b < a/2$. Quotient in this case is 1.\
On the other hand, when $ b < a/2$, $a$ mod $b$ $< b$ $\le a/2$.

Euclid's Algorithm is the optimum algorithm for the problem of finding GCD of 2 numbers. The time complexity being $O(log a)$.

After every 2 steps, first operand becomes half.
Thus after $2log(a)$ steps the input becomes 0.  
After 2 steps, first operand becomes half, one -fourth in 4 steps, one-eigth in 6 steps, one-eight in 8 steps. 

### Extended Euclid's Algorithm 

>Generalization of GCD 

>Lemma :- If d divides a and b, and d = ax + by, for some integers x and y, then necessarily d = gcd(a, b).

>Another formulation of the problem can be that the smallest integer number that can be written as d = ax + by, where x and y are integers is necessarily gcd (a, b).

**Proof** 
>d divides a and b, which implies, $d\le gcd(a, b)$. Also, $gcd(a, b)$ is a common divisor of a and b thus it must also divide $d = ax + by$, which implies $d\ge gcd(a, b)$.
Thus, $d = gcd (a, b)$.

>Extended Euclid Algorithm not only finds the gcd but the integer coefficients x and y as well. 

**Algorithm**
```cpp
function extended-Euclid(a, b)

if b = 0:
    return (1, 0, a)
(x', y', d) = Extended-Euclid(b, a mod b)   

return (y', x' - [a/b]y', d)

### Modular Divison

We can extend the modular multiplication concept to modular division by introducing the notion of inverse.\
$1/b$ can be written as b<sup>-1</sup>.\
$(a*b)%n$ can be written as `((a % n)*(b % n)) % n` , to extend this logic to division,

`(a/b) % n = (a*(b^-1)) % n = ((a % n)*(b^-1 % n)) % n`

Thus, we define inverse modular division as :

>For any a mod N , $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $N$ if and only if it is relatively prime to N.

>When N is prime, the concept of modular division becomes all the more important.

> When such an inverse exists it can be found in order $O(n^3)$ time, where n is the number of bits of N, by running Euclid algorithm.

### Public-Key Cryptography

We have several different operations that we can perform on numbers.

These operations include

    Addition
    Multiplication
    Comparison etc.

In general, comparison is considered to be the most frequent operation followed by addition and then multiplication.    

Ease/speed of operations on numbers depends on the **representation**.

We can have several different way to represent these numbers, such as

    Roman numeral system (I , II , III , IV, and so on)
    Decimal system (1,2,3,4 and so on )
    Prime factorization / prime product system (1, 2, 3, 2 ^2, 5, 2.3 and so on)
    Residue system involving the mod operation , and others.

**Why is decimal system the most popular representation system ?**
>For numbers, comparison is considered to be the most common operation, followed by addition and then multiplication. Thus, the decimal system has net fastest performance w.r.t these operation and their frequency.(Refer to the table).
>Though in some situation like AI, addition and multiplication are more frequent than comparsion, thus residue system is favoured.

A key can be represented in several different ways.

Each key has a public and private representation.

A cryptographic system has 3 major characterstics :

    - K (key)
    - E (encryption algorithm)
    - D (decryption algorithm)(E^-1)

The difference in ease/speed of different operations in different representations is brought into use in crypotogrpahy.

Choose a representation $R_1$ such that the operation D is FAST (for private) and the a representation $R_2$ such that the operation E is FAST while the operation $D$ or $E^-1$ is VERY SLOW (for public).

```
EXAMPLE RSA Cryptosystem
R_1 : Product of Primes
R_2 : Decimal
E_K : Modular Exponentiation m_e mod K
```
### RSA
RSA security depends on the computational limitation of factoring large integers.
It uses the fact that it is easier to multiply 2 large integers, but quite difficult to factorize a large integer.

**Algorithm**
```
Pick any two primes p and q and let N = pq.

For any e relatively prime to (p -1)(q - 1):
    The mapping f(x) = x e mod N is a bijection on {0, 1, ... N-1}
Moreover, the inverse mapping is easily realized:
    let d be the inverse of e modulo (p -1)(q - 1).
    Then for all x in {0,...N-1}
    (x_e) d mod N = x mod N
