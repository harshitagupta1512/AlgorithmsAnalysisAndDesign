### Problem 3 - Edit Distance

### Problem
>Find the minimum number of insert/delete/overwrite operations to convert one word to another.

>This problem is symmetric in nature, that is, given two words A and B the minimum number of insert/delete/overwrite operations to convert A to B is same as those needed to convert B to A.

>Another perspective to look at the problem will be that a natural measure of the distance between two strings is the extent to which they can be aligned, or matched up.

>For example, here is an alignment of `SNOWY` and `SUNNY`:

>This alignment translates as - if you want to convert SUNNY TO SNOWY - the first column is [- S] which implies that you delete S from SUNNY, after that you overwrite U to S, then you do nothing with N (in the third column [N N]), insert O and W, followed by deleting N and then doing nothing for Y.

>Similarly for coverting SNOWY to SUNNY - first insert S at the beginning, overwrite S to U, do nothing for N, delete O and W, add N amd do nothing for Y.

>Thus, if you want to convert A to B, you align the words one below another, a column can have four possible states

$$\begin{pmatrix} - \\ c \end{pmatrix}
or
\begin{pmatrix} c \\ - \end{pmatrix}
or
\begin{pmatrix} c \\ c' \end{pmatrix}
or
\begin{pmatrix} c \\ c \end{pmatrix}
$$

>W.r.t converting A to B,\
the first state implies that insert c in A at that position. Similarly second state implies that delete c from that position in A, third state implies to overwrite c with c', fourth state implies no change.

>The cost of an alignment is the number of columns in which the letters differ. And the edit distance between two strings is the cost of their best possible alignment.

>So, a better alignment for `SNOWY` and `SUNNY` can be\

### Solution

**What Are The Sub-Problems?**
> `E(i, j)` - edit distance between some prefix of the first string, $x[1 ... i]$, and some prefix of the second, $y[1 ... j]$.

>$m = strlen(x)$, $n = strlen(y)$\
>Our goal is to find the edit distance between strings $x[1.....m]$ and $y[1.....n]$, that is, E(m, n).

**Expressing `E(i, j)` in terms of smaller sub-problems**
>$E(i, j) = min(1 + E(i-1, j), 1 + E(j, i - 1), diff(i, j) + E(i-1, j-1))$, where $diff(i, j) = 0$ when $x[i] = y [j]$ and 1 otherwise.

>When aligning $x[1....i]$ and $y[1....j]$, the righmost column can be
1. $$\begin{pmatrix} x[i] \\ - \end{pmatrix}
$$ 
>delete $x[i]$, $E(i, j) = 1 + E(i-1, j)$
2. $$\begin{pmatrix} - \\ y[j] \end{pmatrix}
$$ 
>$insert y[j]$, $E(i, j) = 1 + E(i, j - 1)$
3. $$\begin{pmatrix} x[i] \\ y[j] \end{pmatrix}
$$ 
>overwrite $x[i]$ to $y[j]$ $E(i, j) = diff(i, j) + E(i - 1, j - 1)$


>The answers to all the subproblems E(i , j) form a two-dimensional table.

>In what order should these sub-problems be solved ?\
>$E(i - 1, j), E(i , j - 1), E(i - 1, j - 1)$ are to be solved before E(i , j). So, we go solving every sub-problem row-wise.

**Algorithm**
```cpp
for i = 0,1,2,...m:
    E(i, 0) = i
for j = 0,1,2,...n:
    E(j, 0) = j
for i = 0,1,2,...m:
    for j = 0,1,2,...n:
            E(i, j) = min(1 + E(i-1, j), 1 + E(j, i - 1), diff(i, j) + E(i-1, j-1))
return E(m, n)
````

>Time Complexity - O(m, n) to find the edit distance between two strings of length m and n.

**Example**

Find the edit Distance between `EXPONENTIAL` and `POLYNOMIAL`

>We initialize the first row and first column, {$E(i, 0) = i $ amd $E(0, j) = j as one would need to insert the j characters to the first string to make it same as the senod $}\.

>Then we go row-wise solving the subproblems. If we track the changes back from $E(m, n)$ to $E(0, 0)$, we will get the alignment corresponding to the edit distance.

>Here, edit distance = 6, that means one can change the word `EXPONENTIAL` to `POLYNOMIAL` or vica versa in at least 6 edit operations, there can be exponential number of alignments corresponding to the edit distance as inside min{} one can have multiple equal values giving us multiple choices as how to edit.

>The implicit underlying DAG for this problem looks something like this with the white circles as it's, nodes.

>The black circles give us a path for alignment with edit distance = 6. Let us start with the string `POLYNOMIAL`, the series of steps will be,\
 add E, add X, do nothing, do nothing, overwrite (L-> N), overwrite (Y-> E), do nothing, delete O, overwrite (M->T), do nothing, do, nothing, do nothing.

>Digonal arrow implies overwrite or do nothing(if $x[i] == y[j]$), horizontal arrow implies delete $x[i]$, vertical arrow implies insert $y[j]$.
