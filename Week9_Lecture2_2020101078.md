## Class NP
In week 1, lecture 2 we learnt that there is a one to one correspondence between languages and decision problems. It is not necessary that every problem will have a solution.

The Church-Turing thesis says that every solvable decision problem can be transformed into an equivalent turing machine problem.

We categorise the computational problems solvable in polynomial time as the *P class*. \
If we look at those problems which are hard i.e there is no deterministic efficient algorithm, as of now, to solve that problem we can further categorise those problems whose solutions, if ever found, can be verified in polynomial time as the *NP class* *(Non -deterministic polynomial time)*.

**Deciders and Verifiers**
>A decider solves the problem, outputs `true` if the input belongs to the set of inputs for which the output of the problem should be true, otherwise `false`.

> A verifier for a language $A$ is an algorithm $V$, where \
 $A =$ {$w | V$ accepts $<w, c>$ for some string $c$ }.\
Time of a verifier is measured in terms of the length of $w$. A polynomial time verifier runs in polynomial time in the length of $w$. A language $A$ is polynomially verifiable if it is has a polynomial time verifier.   

>The *NP class* is the set of all languages that have polynomial verifiers. If you can prove to the world that your solution works in polynomial time, the problem comes under the *NP class*.

*Is the number problems in the P class i.e. the ones with efficient solutions and number of problems in NP class i.e. with polynomial time verifier same?*

*How can one prove that there is no polynomial time verifier for a problem?*

### Examples of languages in NP

#### Example 1
**Problem** - Does a given graph have a k-clique in it ?\
**Decider** - CLIQUE = {(G, k) | G is an undirected graph with a k-clique}\

This problem in the worst case, cannot be solved in polynomial time. But we know that if ever we find the solution to this problem it can be verified in polynomial time.\

A `clique` is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph `G` such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent; i.e. it's induced subgraph is complete.

**PROOF** - Verifier V for CLIQUE\
V = On input $((G, k), c)$,
1. Test whether c is a set of k nodes in G.
2. Test whether G contains all edges connecting nodes in c.
3. If both pass, accept; otherwise, reject.

Certificate, c, is some string that will help the verifier to verify whether the input belongs to the language. As long as there exist a certificate the problem is NP.\
Here the clique is the certificate itself.\
This verifier is linear-time.

#### Example 2
**Problem** - Given a set and a target sum, find a subset of the given set whose elements sum to the target sum.

SUBSET-SUM  = { (S, t) | S = {$x_1, x_2, .... x_k$} and for some {$y_1, ......, y_l$} $\subseteq$ {$x_1, x_2, .... x_k$} we have $\sum y_i = t$.

There is no efficient algorithm to solve this problem in polynomial time, i.e it is not NP but it belongs in the *class NP* because if somebody finds a solution somehow, it can be verified in polynomial time.

**PROOF**
*Verifier V* for SUBSET-SUM
V = On input ((S, t), c):
1. Test whether c is a collection of numbers that sum to t.
2. Test whether S contains all the numbers in c.
3. If both pass, *accept*; otherwise, reject.

The certificate is the subset itself.\
If the verifier accepts you know that the input belongs to the language and if it rejects you know that it does not belong to the language.

### NP versus co-NP
Complements of te sets CLIQUE and SUBSET-SUM are not members of NP.\ 
Verifying that something is not present seems more difficult than verifying is present. We consider a separate complexity class called *coNP*, which contains the languages that are complements of languages in NP. 

*Is coNP different from NP ?*\
All problems in P are in NP and coNP

### P versus NP question

P = the class of languages foe which membership can be *decided* quickly.\
NP = the class of languages for which membership can be *verified* quickly.\

*Is the P and NP set actually the same ? or is the P set a subset of the NP set ?*

### Polynomial Time Reducibility

A function is a polynomial time computable function if some polynomial time turing machine M exists that halts f(w) on it's tape, when started on any input w.

Language $A$ is polynomial time mapping reducible to language $B$, written A $\le$<sub>P</sub> $B$, if a polynomial time computable function exists where for every w, $w \epsilon A \implies f(w) \epsilon B$. Function f is called polynomial time reduction of $A$ to $B$.

In principle, if you want to check the membership of w in A, you reduce it to checking the membership of f(w) in B. It happens when you have a polynomial time computable function, f, which helps convert an input of A to an input of B. Hardness of A cannot exceed the hardness of B.

### 3SAT is polynomial time reducible to CLIQUE

Cross-disciplinary linkages

*Can every problem in NP be represented as a single problem ?*

This interconnection of domains makes us wonder
*Why can't we think of problems which have the property that every problem in the *NP* class can be polynomial time reduced to that problem ?*

#### 3SAT 

**Problem** -
>In Boolean logic, a formula is in *conjunctive normal form (CNF)* if it is a product of sums or an AND of ORs.

$3SAT =$ { $(\emptyset)| \emptyset$ is a satisfiable 3cnf -formula }

Satisfiable problem implies that it is satisfied for any possible set of values of the variables.

We can show that if one can solve the clique problem we can solve the 3SAT problem too.

**PROOF**
> Consider the graph G which is organized into k groups of 3 nodes each called the triplets $t_1, t_2, t_3, .... t_k$.\
Number of literals in $\emptyset$ is same as the number of nodes in G. \
Each triplet corresponds to one of the clauses in $ \emptyset $ and each node in the triplet corresponds to a literal in the associated clause. Thus we label each node of G with it's corresponding literal in $\emptyset$.

>The edges of G connect all but two types of pairs of nodes in G. No edge is present between nodes in the same triplet and no edge is present between nodes with contradictory labels such as $\bar{x}$ and $x$. 

>We show that $\emptyset$ is satisfiable iff $G$ has a $k-clique$. We can think of universal languages.

### NP - COMPLETENESS
A language B is NP-complete if it satisfies 2 conditions:
1. B is in NP, and
2. every A in NP polynomial time reducible to B.

This will imply that if you can solve B, you can solve every problem in NP. Every language in NP belongs to language B.

If only second condition is satisfies language B is categorised as *NP Hard*.  

NP Complete = NP $\cap$ NP Hard

Polynomial time reducibility is a transitive property.

*If B is NP-Complete and B $\le$ <sub>P</sub> C for C in Np, then C is NP-Complete*

*COOK - LEVIN THEOREM* - SAT IS NP COMPLETE. -- covered in Advanced Algorithms Course
