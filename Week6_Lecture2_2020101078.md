### Problem 4 - CHAIN-MATRIX MULTIPLICATION

Problem
>Given a chain $(A_1, A_2 . . . . , A_n)$ i of n matrices, where for i = $1, 2 . . . . , n$, matrix $A_i$ has dimension $m$<sub>i-1</sub> $\times m_i $ parenthesize the product $A_1 \times A_2 . . . . \times A_n$ in a way that minimizes the number of scalar multiplications.

Suppose we want to multiply 4 matrices A, B, C and D. This will involve iteratively multiplying two matrices at a time.\
Matrix multiplication is not commutative($A X B \neq B X A$) but it is associative $(AX(BXC) = ((AXB)XC))$. Thus, we can compute our product in many different ways, depending on how we **parenthesize** it. Some parenthesization being better than others. But all parenthesizations yield the same product. How we parenthesize a chain of matrices can have a dramatic impact on the **cost** of evaluating the product.\
The standard algorithm to multiply two matrices is 
```cpp
if A.columns != B.rows
    error “incompatible dimensions”
else let C be a new A.rows X B.columns matrix
    for i = 1 to A.rows
        for j = 1 to B.columns
            c_ij = 0
        for k = 1 to A.columns
        c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k] * b[k][j]

    return C
````
The time to compute C is dominated by the number of scalar multiplications in, which is $mnp$ (A is $m \times n$ and B is $n \times p$). Thus, we express costs in terms of the number of scalar multiplications.

We use dynamic-programming method to determine how to optimally parenthesize a matrix chain.

A particular parenthesization can be represented by binary tree in which the individual matrices correspond to the leaves, the root is the final
product, and interior nodes are intermediate products. The possible orders in which to do the multiplication correspond to the various full binary trees with n leaves, whose number is exponential in n .

**What Are The Sub-Problems?**

For a tree to be optimal, it's subtrees must also be optimal. 
for $1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n$, define

 $C(i, j)$ = minimum cost of multiplying $A_i × A$<sub>i+1</sub>$ × · · · × A_j$.

Smallest subproblem is when $i = j$, in which case there’s nothing to multiply, so $C(i, i) = 0$.

The first branch in the subtree, split the product in two pieces, of the form $A_i × · · · × A_k$ and $A$<sub>k+1</sub>$ × · · · × A_j$ , for some $ i <= k <= j$.

The cost of the subtree is the sum of the cost of these two partial products, plus the cost of combining/multiplying them : 

$C(i, k) + C(k + 1, j) + m_i−1 · m_k · m_j$

To find - the splitting point k for which this is smallest:
$ C(i, j) = min () C(i, k) + C(k + 1, j) + m_i−1 · m_k . m_j )$


**Algorithm**

```cpp
for i = 1 to n:
    C(i, i) = 0
for s = 1 to n − 1:
    for i = 1 to n − s:
        j = i + s
        C(i, j) = min{C(i, k) + C(k + 1, j) + m[i−1]· m[k] · m[j] : i ≤ k < j}
return C(1, n)
````

**Analysis**
The subproblems constitute a two-dimensional table,each of whose entries takes O(n) time to compute. The overall running time is thus O( n<sup>3</sup> ).

### Problem 5 - KNAPSACK

#### Problem
>During a robbery, a burglar finds much more loot than he had expected and has to decide what to take. His bag (or knapsack) will hold a total weight of `at most` `W` units. There are `n` items to pick from, of weight $w_1 ,..., w_n$ and value $v_1 , ... , v_n$. What's the most valuable combination of items he can fit into his bag?

>One important point here is that the burglar can either pick or not pick an item (0/1), dividing an item in fractions is not allowed. 

#### Solution

>If we say that x is the decision array of size n, $x_i = 1$, if the item is choose or $0$ otherwise.

>Thus, we wish to maiximise $ \sum x_iv_i$ such that $ \sum x_iw_i$ = W, where $v_i$ is the value of i<sub>th</sub> item, $w_i$ is the weight and `W` is the maximum capacity of the bag/knapsack.

>There are a total of 2<sup>n</sup> solutions, valid or not.\
 This problem can be solved optimally by 2-dimensional DP.


##### Solution (Knapsack Without Repetition) 

>**Subproblem**, `K(w, j)` = maximum value achievable with a knapsack of capacity `w` and items $1, 2, 3..j$

The answer to the question as to how we express the subproblem $K(w, j)$ in terms of smaller subproblems is quite easy. The only thing we need to decide is whether to pick item j or not. Thus,

$K(w, j )$ = $ max(K(w-w_j, j - 1) + v_j, K(w, j-1))$

Here, $K(w-w_j, j - 1) + v_j,$ corresponds to the case when we decide to pick j<sup>th</sup> item , now the capacity of knapsack reduces to $w- w_j$ and the available items to choose from are $1, 2, 3...j-1$ the solution to which is the subproblem $K(w-w_j, j - 1)$.

$K(w, j-1)$ on the other hand corresponds to the case where we decide to leave item j, so the available capacity of knapsack is still $w_j$ but the available items are $1, 2, 3...j -1$.

>This 2-D DP solution can be represented as a table

#### Algorithm

```cpp
Initialize all K(0, j) = 0 and all K(w, 0) = 0
for j = 1 to n:
    for w = 1 to W:
        if w[j] < w:
            K(w, j) = K(w, j-1)
        else:
            K(w, j) = max(K(w, j-1), K(w-w[j], j-1) + v[j])
return K(W, n)

###### Time Complexity - $O(nW)$
 

##### Solution (Knapsack With Repetition) 

>There are unlimited number of items of a particular weight and value. So we can pick a item `repeatedly`.

**Subproblem**

>`K(w)` = maximum value achievable with a knapsack of capacity `w'.

>We express this in terms of smaller subproblems

Let the last item added for the optimal solution be the i<sup>th</sup> item.

$K(w) = max(K(w - w_i) + v_i)$ where $i$ = {$[1, n]$ : $w_i$ < w}

**Algorithm**
```cpp
K(0) = 0
for w = 1 to W:
    K(w) = max{K(w- w[i]) + v[i] : w[i]<w}

return K(W)

**Time Complexity** = O(nW)
