### Greedy Algorithms
Greedy approach is applicable and is applied to numerous problems. But there are some problems in which even though the greedy choice property does not hold, greedy approach is used to find the solution which is not global optimum but still a better option than the brute force approach. When the problem is hard we prefer a better solution then exponential naive approach. The main sentiment of greedy approach is how we extend the solution to a local problem to the global optimum solution.
In approximation analysis we compare our solution to the optimum solution even though the optimum solution may not exist.  

### Set Cover
**Problem**
>Given a set of elements, say B and sets ${S_1, S_2, S_3, ...}$ which are subsets of set B. Output required is the minimum number of subsets whose union equals B.

**Greedy Approach**
>Repeat until all elements in B are covered:\
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick the set with largest number of uncovered elements.


>**Example 1**\
B = {a, d, e, i ,l ,n, o, r, s, t, u}
S = {arid, dash, drain, heard, lost, nose, shun, slate, snare, thread, lid, roast}
The first pick will be "thread" since it has the largest number of elements and since it is the beginning no elements are covered yet. Now, the uncovered set is {i, l, n, o, s, u}, the next pick will be
"lost" and the uncovered set will now have only 3 elements left {i, n, u}, the next pick will be "drain" followed by "shun". Thus the final cost will be 4. The question is that is this solution optimum ?\
The idea is that "shun" is the mandatory pick as it is the only set conatining element 'u', now i and e do not occur in any set simultaneously, so we need atleast two more words to cover both of them. 
Sets containing i are {arid, drain, lid} and sets conatining e are {heard, nose, slate, snare, thread}. Uncovered set after choosing\ "arid" = {e, l, o, t}\
"drain" = {e, l, o, t}\
"lid" = {a, e, o, r, t}\
Covering these elements will require two more words one from the e containing words and one from the remaining. Thus in this example greedy approach gives the optimum solution.

>**Example 2**\
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6}\
$S_1$ = {1, 2, 3 ,4}\
$S_2$ = {1, 3, 5}\
$S_3$ = {2, 4, 6}\
Going with the greedy approach we will first choose $S_1$, then $S_2$ and $S_3$, cost = 3. Though the optimum solution would be choosing $S_2$ and $S_3$, cost = 2. Thus greedy approach is not optimal.

But luckily, it isn’t too far from optimal.

### Approximation Algorithms
**Claim** - Suppose B contains n elements and that the optimal cover consists of k sets. Then the
greedy algorithm will use at most k $ln (n)$ sets.

**Proof**
>Let $n_t$ be the number of elements still not covered after t iterations of the greedy algorithm
(so $n_0 = n$ that is number of uncovered elements at t = 0).\
>Since these remaining elements are covered by the optimal k sets ( k is the optimal solution which implies that those k sets cover all the n elements so they will obviously cover the remaining elements after t iterations of greedy algorithm), so there are $n_t$ elements covered by k sets. 
>> The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than or equal to n/m items.

> Thus by pigeonhole principle, there must be some set with at least $n_t / k$ of them. Therefore, the greedy strategy will ensure that in the next interation it will choose the set with maximum number of uncovered elements, we know that we have a set with atleast $n_t$/k elements so after the next iteration the number of uncovered elements will decrease by atleast $n_t$ / k.\
 n<sub>t+1</sub> <= $n_t$ - $n_t$/k = $n_t$(1 - 1/k)\
By repeated application of this equation, we get
$n_t$ <= $n_0$(1 - 1 / k).

>Using the inequality 1 - x <= e<sup>-x</sup> for all x ( https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vg219kiys2, as clearly visible in the graph) (with equality holding for only x = 0), we can say that\
$n_t$ <= $n_0$(1 - 1/k) <= $n_0$(e<sup>-1/k</sup>)<sup>t</sup>\
At t = k$ln(n)$, $n_t$ is strictly less than ne <sup>−$ln(n)$</sup> = 1, which means no elements remain to be covered. 


The ratio between the greedy algorithm’s solution and the
optimal solution varies from input to input but is always less than $ln(n)$. We call this maximum ratio the approximation factor of the greedy algorithm. There seems to be a lot of room for improvement, but in fact such hopes are unjustified, it turns out that there is provably no polynomial-time algorithm for the set cover problem with a smaller approximation factor.
