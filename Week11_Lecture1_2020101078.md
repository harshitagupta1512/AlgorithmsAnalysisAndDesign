## Some more examples of proving NP-Completeness

Main idea to prove a problem to be NP-complete will be to prove that there is a *polynomial-time reduction* from 3-SAT to that problem assuming *3-SAT* is *NP-complete*.

We saw a polynomial time reduction from 3-SAT to Clique in last lecture and from SAT to 3-SAT.
Proof for the same will be discussed in the Advanced Algorithms Course.

*Cook’s Theorem* proves that satisfiability is NP-complete by reducing all non-deterministic Turing machines to SAT.

A decision problem is NP-hard if the time complexity on a deterministic machine is within a polynomial factor of the complexity of any problem in NP. A problem is *NP-complete* if it is *NP-hard* and in *NP*.

Cook’s theorem proved *SATISFIABILITY* was NP-hard by using a polynomial time reduction translating each problem in NP into an instance of SAT.



### Vertex-Cover

**Problem**
>If G is an undirected graph, a vertex cover of G is a subset of nodes where every edge of G touches one of those nodes (each edge has one of it's endpoints in the set). The vertex cover problem asks whether a graph contains a vertex cover of a specified size:
```c
VERTEX-COVER = {<G, k> | G is an undirected graph that has a k-node vertex cover}
````
Every graph does have a vertex cover - set of all nodes. The optimisation problem will be to find the vertex cover with minimum number of nodes. 

There are no efficient solution for this problem. 

**To show :- VERTEX COVER is NP-complete**

We know VERTEX-COVER is in *NP*, so the only thing left to show is that it is *NP-Hard*. For this we need to show that 3-SAT is polynomial-time reducible to vertex cover. In other words we show that if you can solve SAT, you can solve vertex cover or you can convert an instance of vertex cover to a instance of SAT in polynomial time.

*Reduction from 3-SAT to VERTEX-COVER*

We know that $\phi$ has multiple clauses with 3 literals each. For each literal x in $\phi$ we construct 2 nodes x and $\bar{x}$.\
Map a boolean formula $\phi$ to a graph G and a value k. For each variable x in $\phi$, we produce an edge connecting two nodes. We label the 2 nodes x and $\bar{x}$. Setting x to be TRUE corresponds to selecting left node for the vertex cover, whereas FALSE corresponds to the right node. Triple of 3 nodes that are labelled with 3 literals of the clause.

These 3 nodes are connected to each other and to the nodes in the variables gadgets that have the identical label. Thus the total number of nodes that appear in G is $2m + 3l$ where $\phi$ has $m$ variables and $l$ clauses. Let $k$ be $m + 2l$.

*Bottom Band* - There is a triangle of edges for each clause. 
*Top Band* - There is a edge between each $x_i$ and $\bar{x_i}$.

You connect every node from the bottom band to a similarly labelled node in the top band. 

The construction of the reduction id clearly polynomial-time or in fact linear.

**Proof that this reduction works**

*To show - If $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if G has a vertex cover with k nodes*

There are 3l nodes in bottom band and 2m nodes in top band and we need a vertex cover of size 3l + 2m. We need to prove 
1. If $\phi$ is satisfiable then such a vertex cover exists.
2. If such a vertex cover exists, $\phi$ is satisfiable. 

Satisfying Assignment - Atleast one literal in every clause is true.

We select one *true* literal in every clause and put the remaining two nodes from every clause gadget into the *vertex cover*.
We have a total of k nodes. They cover all edges as every variable gadget edge is covered, all 3 edges within every clause gadget are covered, and all edges between variable and clause gadgets are covered. 

To make a satisfying assignmenet we 

Hence G has a vertex cover with k nodes. 

### Subset Sum

**Problem**
> Given a set of numbers $S ={x_1, x_2, x_3, .... x_k}$ and for some ${y_1, y_2, ... y_l}$ $\subseteq$ ${x_1, x_2, x_3, .... x_k}$, we have $\sum y_i = t$.

We proved that this problem is in *NP* in last lecture. Thus the only thing left to prove is that the problem is NP-hard.

*Can we convert an instance of Subset Sum problem to an instance of 3-SAT ?*

Consider a 3-cnf formula $\phi$ and we construct a SUBSET-SUM problem that contains a sub collection T summing to the target t if and only if $\phi$ is satisfiable. 

Let $\phi$ be a boolean formula with l variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_l$ and k clauses $c_1, c_2, ... c_k$. 

**Reduction of $\phi$ to $(S,t)$**

We have k clauses, l variables, create a integer which has l + k digits, each of the digits being `0` or `1`. Though all these numbers are in decimal base only.

*How to form this number ?*
S contains one pair of numbers $y_i, z_i$ for each variable $x_i$ in $\phi$. 

These numbers are as indicated in the table below. The left hand part comprises a 1 followed by l - i 0s. The right hand part contains one digit for each clause, where the jth digit of $y_i$ is 1 if clause $c_j$ contains literal $x_i$ and jth digit of $z_i$ is 1 if clause $c_j$ contains literal $\bar{x_i}$. 

All other digits not specified to be `1` are `0`.

S contains another pair of numbers $g_i, h_i$ for each clause $c_j$. These two numbers are equal and consists of a 1 followed by $k-j$ $0s$.

The target number t, consists of $l$ `1`s followed by $k$ `3`s.

Suppose $\phi$ is satisfiable. Construct a subset S as follows. Select $y_i$ if $x_i$ is assigned TRUE in satisfying assignment and $z_i$ if $x_i$ is assigned FALSE. If we add up what we have selected so far, we will obtain a 1 in each of the first l digits . Further, each of the k digits is a number between q and 3 because each clause is satisfied and contains between 1 and 3 true literals. We now select enough of g and h numbers to bring each of the k digits up to 3, thus hitting the target. 

Suppose subset $S$ sums to $t$. We can construct a satisfying assignment to $\phi$ after the following observations :
1. All the digits in members of S are either 0 or 1.
2. Each column in the table describing S contains at most fives `1`s. Thus, a carry into the next column never occurs when a subset S is added.
3. To get a `1` in each of the first $l$ columns the subset must have either $y_i$ or $z_i$ for each $i$, but not both.

**The satisfying assignment**

If the subset contains $y_i$, we assign $x_i$ true; otherwise false. This assignment must satisfy $\phi$ because in each of the final k columns the sum is always 3. In column $c_j$, at most 2 can come from $g_j$ and $h_j$, so atleast 1 in this column must come from some $y_i$ or $z_i$ in the subset. If it is $y_i$, them $x_i$ appears in $c_j$ and is assigned true so $c_j$ is satisfied. If it is $x_i$, them $\bar{x_i}$ appears in $c_j$ and is assigned true so $c_j$ is satisfied.

This $\phi$ is satisfied.

### Summary
Vertex Cover is NP-complete.
