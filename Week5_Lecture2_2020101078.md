## Dynamic Programming

For a computational problem, if the greedy choice property does not hold though optimum subtructure property does and there are multiple overlapping subproblems, we use dynamic programming to find the solution.
From a rough view, DP involves recursion and a DAG of subproblems. A DAG is a directed acyclic graph, that is a graph with directed edges and no cycles. In the DAG if there is a edge from A to B, it implies that solving the subproblem B requires the solution of subproblem A. Thus a cycle in the graph results in a deadlock (A requires B, B requires C, C requires A).

#### Problem 1 - Shortest Path in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
Given a DAG, first sort the edges using topological sort.
>**Topological Sorting** - A linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological sort is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

Now we can divide the problem into a sequence of subproblems.

For example, we consider the following DAG.
To Find - Shortest Path from node S to node E.\

After topological sorting, the graph can be redrawn as,\

In this graph, all the edges are in ine direction i.e. left to right. So the problem to find shortest path from S to E can be divided into subproblems like find the shortest path from S to C, S to A, S to B etc.

**Algorithm**
````
initialize all dist(.) values to infinity
dist(S) = 0
for each v in V - {S} in linearized order:
    dist(v) = min<sub>(u,v) in E { dist(u) + l(u,v)}
````

For each vetex we find the shortest path from S (source vertex) to that vertex. These subproblems are overlapping as we can find shortest distance for the v<sub>i</sub><sup>th</sup> vertex by using the already calculated shortest distance of one of the previously occuring vertex in the linearized order (after toplogical sorting). To do that we find the edge with least weight ending at v<sub>i</sub>, `dist(v<sub>i</sub>) = the weight of that edge + dist(the starting vertex of the edge)`.

From our example,\
dist(`S`) = `0`\
For `C`, it has 1 in-neighbour that is S, dis(C) = dis(S) + 2 = `2`\
For `A`, it has 2 in-neighbours (S and C) dis(A) = min{dis(C) + 4, dis(S) + 1} = `1`\
For `B`, it has 1 in-neighbour, A, dis(B) = dis(A) + 6 = `7`\
For `D`, it have 2 in-neighbours(B and C) dis(D) = min{dis(B) + 1, dis(C) + 3} = `5`\
For `E`, it has 2 in-neighbours(B and D) dis(E) = min{7 + 2, 5 + 1} = `6`.

This the shortest distance from `S` to `E` is `6` and the shortest path is `S->C->D->E`.

The problem to find the longest path in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) can be solved using DP just in the same way. All one needs to do is replace minimum with maximum in the algorithm.
````
initialize all dist(.) values to 0
dist(S) = 0
for each v in V - {S} in linearized order:
    dist(v) = max<sub>(u,v) in E { dist(u) + l(u,v)}
````

There are other methods apart from DP like Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph that is not a DAG.\
But finding the longest path in a graph which is not DAG is a NP hard problem, that is, it cannnot be solved in polynomial time so it is considered to be a tougher problem than shortest path in case of general graphs.\
The point is that in case of general graphs which are not DAGs, there exist cycles due to which topological order of the edges does not exist, as a result we cannot use DP.

#### Problem 2 - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

For every problem solvable by DP, there exist a implicit underlying DAG of subproblems.

**Input**
> Sequence of n numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ....., a_n$\
> Subsequence of a sequence is a set of some elements {$a_i1, a_i2,a_i3,....,a_ik$} from the sequence where $1<=i1<i2<i3<i4.....<ik<=n$.\
>An increasing subsequence is one in which the numbers are getting strictly larger.\
>The task is to find the increasing subsequence of greatest length.

**Example**
>Sequence = 5, 2, 8, 6, 3, 6, 9, 7\
LIS = 2, 3, 6, 9

Firstly, we create the underlying DAG of the subproblems.\
Create a graph of all permissible transitions.\
Represent each element in the sequence as a node and draw them in a straight line in the order in which they appear in the sequence that is $a_1, a_2, a_3, ....., a_n$.\
Given $i < j$ connect vertex $a_i$ and $a_j$ if and only if $a_i$ and $a_j$ can occur as consecutive elements in one of the increasing subsequences that will happen only when
$a_i < a_j$.

For our example,
![ ](https://github.com/Github-Classroomtest/assignment-harshitagupta1512/blob/d0e8cca56229b4e960eb9f4bde375435cdccc27b/Pictures/DP_DAG_LIS.png)

Now in this graph, all possible path, from any source node to any destination node (which is to the right of the source node) is a possible increasing subsequence of our sequence.\
The problem differs here from finding the longest path in a DAG as the source and destination nodes are not fixed.

**DAG of Subproblems**
**Subproblem** - $L(j)$ is the length of longest path ending at j that is $L(j)$ is the length of LIS with $a_j$ as it's last term.

**Collection of Subproblems** = {$L(j)$ : $1<=j<=n$}.\
$L(j)$ = 1 + max {$L(i):(i, j)$ in E}


>All edge weights are equal to 1.

Thus, these subproblems are overlapping.

**Algorithm**
```cpp
for j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n
    L(j) = 1 + max{L(i):(i,j) in E}
return max{L(j)}
````  
For a particluar j, among all $i < j$ s.t. 
$a_i < a_j$ take the $i$ for which $L(i)$ is maximum.

To find the actual sequence, we would need to book-keep the i at which $L(i)$ is maximum for a particular $j$.


In DP, there is an order of the subproblems and a relation that shows how to solve a subproblem, given the solutions to the previous (smaller) subproblems in the order.

The three main steps in solving a problem using DP are
1. How to get the subproblems.
2. Formula for the solution of the larger subproblem in terms of solution to smaller subproblems.
3. In what loop order should the subproblems be solved (topological sort of the underlying DAG).

The two aforementioned examples are that of one-dimension DP.
